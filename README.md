## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

menu-icon: 
translate(x, y)- translate allows you to change element position.

transition(0.4s)- transition allows you to change css property values smoothly

Pls why does the hamburger .menu_icon lines translate function work with "this" but dosen't work with "e.target" ? i thought they both refer to the element
